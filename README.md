# TicTacToe

This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game that I made. In it you play against the computer, and it will try to win as much as it can. I use ncurses to make the graphics so I'm not sure if you will need to install that on your instalation to make it work.

### Example
Here is an example of one of the strategies the AI will use when trying to beat you. Have fun!
```
\ \ / /  *          * \ \ / /
